This is a sale control system with some subsystems based in Kurdish language

when i started working on this project i was an accountant in north of Iraq (Kurdistan) and i couldn't find any useful
software to control flow of company and i decided to write my own tools to make efficient control over there.

in implementing this projects i used Codeigniter framework 2.2 also some Javascript to make more interactive the application
also for database i used Mysql DB.

so get enjoy.
